# WorkspaceKit filesystem authority contract

## Authority

`WorkspaceFileSystemRootAuthority` is established before an operation begins. It captures:

- one canonical root spelling and its physical `(device, inode)` identity;
- the original URL only for display/security-scope access; and
- a `WorkspaceFileSystemLocation` containing a normalized lexical root-relative path.

The relative path rejects empty, absolute, parent-traversing, and embedded-NUL input. A URL
computed from the original spelling is never filesystem authority.

Each operation opens `/`, walks every canonical-root component, then walks every relative
parent component with `openat(..., O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW)`. It retains that complete
descriptor chain until the operation ends. Every descriptor identity must still match both
its original `fstat` result and the no-follow directory entry under its retained parent.
The anchored layer never follows symlinks. A caller may resolve and containment-check an
allowed alias before constructing a location, but the resulting canonical root-relative path
is the only path the operation retains; any later symlink substitution fails closed.

The chain is validated before opening a leaf and again at operation-specific commit,
durability, rollback, and postflight boundaries. The terminal chain–leaf–chain validation is
repeated after the postflight test hook, so a mutation at the last instrumented boundary is
also rejected before an outcome is returned. Moving,
replacing, exchanging, or changing
the root, any ancestor, or the final parent invalidates the authority with
`namespaceChanged`. Opening `root/nested`, moving it to `root/moved`, recreating
`root/nested`, and continuing through the old descriptor is therefore rejected.

## Coherent reads

Reads open the final leaf once with `O_NOFOLLOW`, require a regular file, and sample metadata
from that descriptor before and after reading. Before returning bytes, the reader validates:

1. the retained root/ancestor/final-parent chain;
2. the final leaf name against the exact descriptor identity;
3. that same retained chain again; and
4. byte count and metadata stability for that descriptor.

`namespaceChanged` is fail-closed and is not retried. Content instability may be retried
within the bounded coherent reader. Cancellation is returned as `cancelled`. No successful
outcome may contain bytes from a descriptor detached from the captured namespace.

Production workspace search first canonicalizes an initially present, in-root alias under its
existing physical-target policy, then builds the canonical location from one request-owned
root authority. Disk results and eligible overlays carry `WorkspaceSearchFileAuthority`: the
location plus the identity sampled from the exact read/validation descriptor. Later activation
work must use that pair rather than derive new authority from the result path.

## Transactional writes

All writes first create a same-directory, exclusive `.plainsong-write-*.tmp` file, preserve
the existing mode when replacing, write all bytes, `fsync` the file, and capture its metadata.
The target and complete namespace chain are revalidated before commit.

For an existing destination, commit uses
`renameatx_np(RENAME_SWAP | RENAME_NOFOLLOW_ANY)`. The displaced entry remains rollback
material until the writer has validated both names, validated the entire chain, synced the
parent directory, and completed post-sync validation. Only then may it unlink the displaced
entry and sync that cleanup.

For a missing destination, commit uses
`renameatx_np(RENAME_EXCL | RENAME_NOFOLLOW_ANY)`. A racing creator is never overwritten.
The new leaf, complete chain, and parent-directory sync must all pass before the create is
durable.

Any post-rename failure attempts rollback through the same retained authority. Existing-file
rollback performs the reverse swap; missing-file rollback unlinks the created destination.
Rollback is validated and its parent directory is synced before the writer may report that
the write was not committed. If commit or rollback state cannot be proven, the writer keeps
available recovery material and reports an indeterminate outcome. Cancellation follows the
same rule and cannot turn a possibly visible commit into an ordinary failure.

## Outcome model

`WorkspaceFileWriteOutcome` forces callers to handle three states:

| Outcome | Proven state | Caller action |
|---|---|---|
| `notCommitted` | New bytes are proven absent from the destination namespace. | Preserve the current document; inspect `artifactState` for temporary cleanup. |
| `committedAndDurable` | New destination bytes and the commit directory entry are durable. | Adopt returned metadata; process any retained or removal-indeterminate cleanup artifact. |
| `committedButIndeterminate` | New bytes may be visible, or rollback durability/namespace continuity could not be proven. | Stop blind retries and reconcile using destination state, `preparedMetadata`, and any recovery artifact. |

Artifact state is independently typed as `none`, `retained(location)`, or
`removalIndeterminate(location)`. A namespace-change outcome does not authorize resolving the
same mutable URL again; reconciliation must first establish fresh authority.

`MarkdownFileStore.save(text:at:expecting:)` returns this outcome unchanged. Its legacy URL
save maps durable success normally, maps proven non-commit to `unwritable`, and surfaces
indeterminate commit state as `writeRequiresReconciliation` rather than claiming failure.
That synchronous compatibility facade finishes its transaction even when it inherits a
cancelled scheduling task; the typed location API continues to honor cancellation and expose
its exact outcome.

## Deterministic regression boundary

WorkspaceKit tests use synchronous event hooks and injected syscall-boundary failures—never
timing sleeps—to cover:

- symlink, intermediate, root, final-parent, and leaf substitution;
- existing and missing coherent reads;
- swap replacement, exclusive create, and exclusive-create collision;
- failure after swap/exclusive rename, displaced-entry capture, postcommit leaf validation,
  parent-directory sync, postflight namespace replacement, rollback, cleanup unlink, and
  cleanup sync;
- durable rollback versus typed indeterminate rollback;
- cancellation and temporary-artifact cleanup; and
- canonical bytes, moved/replacement bytes, destination identities, outside sentinels, and
  absent or intentionally retained artifacts for every adversarial path.

The focused suites live in `WorkspaceAnchoredFileSystemTests`,
`WorkspaceNamespaceAuthorityTests`, `WorkspaceCoherentFileReaderTests`, and the
`WorkspaceFileWrite*Tests` files.
