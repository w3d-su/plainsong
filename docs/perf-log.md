## Final Checklist Verification Run

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-25 |
| Branch | `m5-final-checklist-docs` |
| Commit | Working tree after the scroll-sync checklist fix on `m5-final-checklist-docs` |
| Result | Automated performance gates passed. At this run, M5 remained feature-complete but not accepted because manual checklist blockers remained in `docs/m5-checklist.md`; later PR #33 supplied the final editor-input evidence and accepted M5. |

Current sweep values from `make test`:

| Metric | Current sweep value | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| Typing latency | 0.309 ms max | Pass |
| Highlight update visible range | Markdown 15.876 ms max; MDX 22.189 ms max | Pass |
| Preview render, 100 KB document | Markdown 62.257 ms median; MDX 15.343 ms median | Pass |
| Memory with 8 warm sessions + 2 webviews | 141.6 MB host RSS; WebKit helpers 498.1 MB across 2 helpers, aggregate 639.7 MB diagnostic | Pass |

## Phase 2 WYSIWYG Zero-width Mechanism Verification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-06-26 |
| Branch | `phase2-wysiwyg-zerowidth-mechanism` |
| Commit | Working tree after replacing the baseline-offset fold mechanism with the TextKit 2 content-storage projection |
| Command | `swift test --filter MarkdownEditorViewTests/testWYSIWYGVisibleRangeFoldRecomputeStaysUnderHighlightBudget` after full `make test` |
| Fixture | `Fixtures/large-1mb.md`, visible-range WYSIWYG fold/highlight/apply path |
| Budget | <= 50 ms |
| Measured | `WYSIWYG visible-range fold highlight/apply: 26.964 ms` |
| Result | Pass |
| Notes | This run verifies B10 in `docs/wysiwyg-release-checklist.md` against the replacement zero-width mechanism. The projection keeps the backing Markdown string canonical and collapses folded delimiter layout without the old `baselineOffset(-1000)` line-height inflation. |

## Phase 2 Link Folding Native Gate Verification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-07-06 |
| Branch | `phase2-link-folding-native-gates` |
| Commit | Working tree for link-folding PR B after PR #65 merged |
| Command | `swift test --package-path Packages/EditorKit --filter WYSIWYG` |
| Fixture | Unmodified `Fixtures/large-1mb.md`; its existing repeated sections already contain inline links |
| Presentation | `.inlineFoldRevealWithLinkFolding` through the TextKit 2 content-storage projection |
| Budget | <= 50 ms |
| Measured | `16.968 ms` max; samples `[16.968, 16.003, 16.134]` after one warm-up |
| Result | Pass |
| Notes | `WYSIWYGLinkPerformanceGateTests.testL8LinkFoldingVisibleRangeRecomputeStaysUnderFiftyMilliseconds` measures visible-range parse, link fold-plan/presentation, in-place attribute apply, and display. The fixture and generator were not changed. |

## Typing Latency

- Fixture: `Fixtures/large-1mb.md`
- Procedure:
  1. Ran `make test`, which includes `PerformanceTests.testTypingLatencyStaysUnderFrameBudget`.
  2. The test reuses `EditorPerformanceProbe.measureTypingHotPath` against the committed
     `Fixtures/large-1mb.md` and covers Markdown plain typing, Markdown newline, Markdown
     auto-pair trigger, MDX plain typing, and MDX JSX trigger.
  3. Captured `TypingLatency` signposts in the Xcode result bundle.
- Measured value: maximum observed sample was 0.254 ms (`mdx jsx trigger`; 50 iterations).
  Other samples: Markdown plain 0.014 ms, Markdown newline 0.108 ms, Markdown pair
  0.194 ms, MDX plain 0.001 ms.
- Result: Pass.
- Notes: Existing EditorKit hot-path frame-budget package tests also passed in the
  same `make test` run.

## Highlight Update

- Fixture: `Fixtures/large-1mb.md` plus an MDX fixture with multiline JSX.
- Procedure:
  1. Ran `PerformanceTests.testVisibleRangeHighlightUpdateAfterEditStaysUnderBudgetForLargeMarkdownAndMDX`.
  2. The test edits the committed 1 MB Markdown fixture and an MDX wrapper around that
     fixture, then highlights a 6 KB viewport-like visible range around the edit.
  3. The highlighter expands the request to whole lines and lightweight frontmatter/fence
     context, parses inline/TSX markup inside that visible request, and applies attributes
     only to the highlighted range.
  4. The measurement includes visible-range tokenization plus in-place attribute apply,
     and excludes preview debounce/render work.
- Measured value: Markdown max 17.918 ms, samples `[17.918, 15.860, 16.691]`;
  MDX max 22.670 ms, samples `[21.703, 21.189, 22.670]`.
- Result: Pass.
- Notes: This pass is based on visible-range-first plumbing and instrumentation, not on
  the historical 250 KB full-document inline parsing cutoff. The partial apply preserves
  selection and scroll position, disables undo registration for style-only edits, and
  skips apply while CJK IME marked text exists.

## Preview Render

- Fixture: `Fixtures/perf-100kb.md`
- Procedure:
  1. Ran `make test`, which includes `PerformanceTests.testPreviewRenderFor100KBMarkdownAndMDXStaysUnderBudget`.
  2. Warmed the preview bridge and MDX parser path, primed the live WebView with the 91,486-byte
     deterministic fixture, then ran three unmeasured settling updates to keep one-time WebKit,
     highlight, and morphdom startup work out of the settled post-debounce budget.
  3. Measured three settled large-document updates from Swift render request to JS
     `renderComplete`.
  4. Gated the median of three settled updates for `.md` and `.mdx` in local runs; raw samples are printed by the test.
  5. Captured `PreviewRenderMarkdown100KB` and `PreviewRenderMDX100KB` signposts in the Xcode result bundle.
- Measured value: Markdown median 46.631 ms, samples `[63.104, 45.942, 46.631]`.
  MDX median 14.556 ms, samples `[14.981, 14.556, 14.355]`.
- Informational cold/prime values: preview bridge warmup 476.351 ms, MDX warmup
  5.672 ms, first 100 KB Markdown prime 86.406 ms, first 100 KB MDX prime 51.054 ms.
  Unmeasured settling renders were Markdown `[79.001, 56.417, 54.737]` and MDX
  `[38.429, 14.946, 14.787]`.
- Result: Pass.
- Notes: The preview path now preserves unchanged highlighted code nodes through morphdom so
  settled large-document updates do not re-highlight unchanged fences. The budget measurement
  intentionally excludes the 150 ms debounce and records settled update render work after
  debounce. The first 100 KB Markdown prime is recorded above as informational, not claimed
  as the passing update measurement. GitHub Actions `macos-15` WebKit runs for PR #20/#21
  observed Markdown medians above the local budget (107.397 ms and 148.847 ms) while MDX
  stayed under budget (44.673 ms and 70.334 ms); those hosted-runner values are recorded
  as CI informational only and are not M5 passing evidence.

## File Open

- Fixture: `Fixtures/perf-500kb.md`
- Procedure:
  1. Ran `make test`, which includes `PerformanceTests.testOpening500KBMarkdownToEditorFirstPaintStaysUnderBudget`.
  2. Warmed the editor surface with a tiny document so one-time AppKit/editor framework
     initialization does not dominate the document-open budget.
  3. Loaded `Fixtures/perf-500kb.md` through `MarkdownFileStore`, created a `DocumentSession`,
     and forced an EditorKit `MarkdownSTTextView` layout/display pass as the first-paint proxy.
  4. Captured `FileOpen500KBFirstPaint` signposts in the Xcode result bundle.
- Measured value: 33.765 ms.
- Result: Pass.
- Notes: This is an automated load + editor paint proxy, not a full Finder/Open Panel UI path.

## Memory

- Scenario: 8 warm document sessions and 2 live preview webviews in a deterministic
  test-only harness.
- Procedure:
  1. Create exactly 8 warm `DocumentSession`s from `Fixtures/perf-500kb.md`.
  2. Attach a first `PreviewController`/`WKWebView` to an offscreen 1280 x 720 AppKit
     surface, wait for bridge readiness, and render/settle `Fixtures/perf-100kb.md`.
  3. Record the single-webview RSS as informational only: 149.3 MB host RSS.
  4. Attach a second live `PreviewController`/`WKWebView` to the same surface, wait for
     bridge readiness, and render/settle an MDX-wrapped `Fixtures/perf-100kb.md`.
  5. Re-check both previews contain their final settled markers, wait one short display
     turn, then record resident memory.
- Measured value: 149.8 MB host RSS with 8 warm `DocumentSession`s and 2 settled live
  `PreviewController` WebViews.
- Result: Pass.
- Notes: The Section 12 M5 memory gate is app host-process RSS. The automated gate asserts
  the same deterministic host-process RSS helper used by PR #15, now with two live previews.
  The test also printed a diagnostic WebKit helper delta of 498.6 MB across 2 OS-managed
  helper processes, for a 648.3 MB aggregate; this is not asserted because WebKit helper
  reuse and process-pool ownership are not stable enough for CI on this local machine. The
  single-webview 149.3 MB value remains informational only and is not used to satisfy the
  Section 12 memory gate.

## Release Configuration Verification (P5)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-07-05 |
| Commit | `main` after PR #59 |
| macOS / Xcode | Build machine OS 26A5368g; Xcode beta 27A5194q (DTXcode 2700, SDK macosx27.0) |
| Machine | Owner's Apple Silicon MacBook Pro (arm64) |
| Build configuration | `Release` + `ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES` override; `-only-testing:PerformanceTests` |
| Command | `xcodebuild -project Plainsong.xcodeproj -scheme Plainsong -configuration Release -derivedDataPath ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/plainsong-perf-release ENABLE_TESTABILITY=YES -only-testing:PerformanceTests test` |
| Result | `** TEST SUCCEEDED **`; all budgets pass |
| Notes | This closes the final P5 item in `docs/release-engineering-plan.md`. Pitfall recorded: pointing `-derivedDataPath` inside `~/Documents` makes the spawned xctest agent unable to read the built bundle (macOS TCC privacy protection on Documents), which surfaces as "The bundle couldn't be loaded because its executable couldn't be located" even though the binary exists — keep test DerivedData under `~/Library/Developer`. |

| Metric | Budget | Release measured | Result |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Typing latency | < 16 ms | 0.525 ms max (markdown pair; other samples ≤ 0.091 ms) | Pass |
| Highlight update visible range | < 50 ms | Markdown 8.517 ms max; MDX 10.050 ms max | Pass |
| Preview render, 100 KB document | < 100 ms after debounce | Markdown 46.680 ms median; MDX 14.721 ms median | Pass |
| File open, 500 KB Markdown | < 300 ms to first paint | 31.977 ms | Pass |
| Memory with 8 warm sessions + 2 webviews | < 400 MB host RSS | 149.3 MB host RSS (WebKit helpers 511.6 MB across 2, aggregate 660.9 MB diagnostic only) | Pass |

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] [#14](https://github.com/w3d-su/plainsong/issues/14): land and instrument visible-range highlighting before claiming the
  < 50 ms highlight-update budget; current evidence uses visible-range-first parsing/apply, not the historical
  250 KB full-document inline parsing cutoff.
- [x] [#13](https://github.com/w3d-su/plainsong/issues/13): add a deterministic two-live-webview memory harness under the
  host-process RSS policy. Issue #13 is closed with the scope note above.
