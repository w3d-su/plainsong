# Link Visual Folding — Sub-Gate Specification

> **Status: SPEC ONLY. Link visual folding remains OFF.**
> `docs/wysiwyg-release-checklist.md` §C.5 defers link folding behind "a separate, explicitly
> approved sub-gate". This document is that sub-gate. Nothing here authorizes enabling link
> folding; every gate below must be checked with linked evidence, and enabling the feature
> requires its own Decision Log entry and PR.

Created 2026-07-02 as planning follow-up after PR #51 (Experimental WYSIWYG dogfood polish)
merged. See `agent.md` §13, `docs/wysiwyg-design.md`, and checklist §C.5/§E.

## 1. Scope

- **In scope:** inline links `[text](url)` in the WYSIWYG (inline fold/reveal) presentation.
  Folding hides the `[`, `](`, `url`, and `)` chrome; the link text stays visible with link
  styling. Reference-style links (`[text][ref]`) and autolinks (`<https://…>`) are explicitly
  **out of scope** for v1 and stay raw.
- **Out of scope (unchanged from checklist §E):** image thumbnails (`![alt](src)` stays raw),
  fenced-code fragments, tables, Mermaid/math widgets, real MDX rendering.
- The pure fold model already carries link ranges (`WYSIWYGFoldModel`; kept model-only since
  PR #38). This spec is about making them *visually* fold.

## 2. Why links are harder than the shipped constructs

Every shipped fold (heading markers, `**`, `~~`, backticks) hides a *short, symmetric*
delimiter whose interior is the visible content. A folded link hides an *asymmetric,
arbitrarily long* run (`](https://very-long-url…)`) that contains meaningful, editable text.
That changes selection, copy, caret, and reveal semantics in ways the existing gates never
exercised:

- The hidden region has real content a user may want to select/edit (the URL), not just
  syntax chrome.
- The boundary between visible text and hidden URL ("destination edge") is where carets land
  when arrowing to the end of the link text.
- Partial selections can start in visible text and end inside the hidden URL.

## 3. Gates

Mirror of the checklist §B matrix, run against the §A content-storage projection mechanism.
Each gate needs a named test (or recorded manual evidence) before it is checked.

### L1 — Fold/reveal model correctness
- [ ] Folding hides exactly `[`, `](url)` (including the URL), keeps `text` visible with link
  styling, and reveal-on-touch restores the full raw source for the touched link only.
- [ ] Nested emphasis inside link text (`[**bold** link](u)`) folds/reveals without range drift.

### L2 — Link chrome UX policy
- [ ] Folded link text renders with a link-styled attribute (color/underline per
  `EditorTheme`); no synthetic characters are inserted (no attachments, no U+FFFC).
- [ ] Pointer policy decided and recorded: plain click places the caret and reveals (Typora
  behavior, per agent.md §17.12); a modifier (⌘-click) opening the URL is optional and, if
  added, must not navigate the editor away or mutate source.

### L3 — Destination-edge selection & caret snapping
- [ ] Arrowing right past the last visible character of link text snaps/reveals per the
  §C.2 edge-snapping policy instead of stranding the caret inside the hidden URL.
- [ ] `WYSIWYGCaretSnap` (or a link-aware extension of it) handles the asymmetric span:
  caret rest inside any hidden `](url)` offset resolves to a visible boundary.
- [ ] Shift-selection across the destination edge keeps raw UTF-16 offsets (no clamping —
  checklist §C.3 stays law).

### L4 — Copy/paste policy (B7 extension)
- [ ] Selection spanning the whole link copies `[text](url)` verbatim.
- [ ] Selection of visible text only copies the text only.
- [ ] Selection ending *inside* the hidden URL copies exactly the selected raw `NSRange`,
  including the partial URL — never a synthesized rendered form.
- [ ] Paste into folded/revealed link regions mutates backing source normally.

### L5 — IME (Zhuyin + Pinyin) at link boundaries
- [ ] Opt-in `PLAINSONG_RUN_ACTUAL_IME=1` harness extended with link-boundary scenarios:
  composition at the start/end of link text and adjacent to the folded destination; no source
  corruption, no caret escape, fold attributes skipped during marked text.

### L6 — Pointer gates
- [ ] Real `NSEvent` click/drag gates (pattern of `WYSIWYGNativePointerGateTests`) rerun with
  folded links: click-to-caret on link text, boundary clicks at both edges, drag selection
  across a folded link copies exact raw Markdown.

### L7 — Accessibility
- [ ] `AXValue` remains the exact raw source (URL included) while folded.

### L8 — Performance
- [ ] Visible-range fold recompute on `Fixtures/large-1mb.md` (which must gain a link-dense
  section if it lacks one) stays within the §12 50 ms budget; record in `docs/perf-log.md`.

### L9 — Undo/redo
- [ ] Link fold presentation never enters undo; editing a URL after reveal undoes as plain
  text edits.

## 4. Exit criteria

All L1–L9 checked with evidence → a dedicated PR may enable link folding **still behind the
Experimental WYSIWYG flag**, with a Decision Log entry recording the pointer policy (L2) and
any caret-snap changes. Stable/default promotion of WYSIWYG as a whole remains governed by
`docs/wysiwyg-release-checklist.md` §F and is not affected by this sub-gate.
